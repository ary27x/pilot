display "Enter the first and the second number : "
get first , second

if first > second : ~ scoping in pilot is done using indentation instead of curly braces
     display "The first number is greater than the second number"

if second > first : 
     display "The second number is greater than the first number"

if first == second:
      display "Both the numbers are equal !"
      display "Try entering two different numbers"
